This is a 2D Game written in Python through the 'Game Programming in Python' Course offered through the Technische Universit√§t Berlin Summer School.

The skeleton code and resources were provided by Kristian Rother through his website - https://www.academis.eu/dungeon_explorer/

main.py contains the main game logic and the graphics engine.
game.py contains the classes and functions used to run the game.
levels.py contains the levels for the game and the elements of each one (enemies, structure, exit, etc)
cutscene.py contains logic and functions for displaying a title screen, game over screen, and a game complete screen.

This game is not finished! I plan to keep working on it to add more levels, items, and enemies.
